  <h2>Waffle Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Eggs</span> This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
  <li><span>Flour</span> All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
  <li><span>Milk</span> Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
  <li> <span>Oil</span> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
  <li><span>Sugar</span> A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness. </li>
  <li><span>Baking Powder</span> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
  <li><span>Salt</span> A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step! </li>
  <li><span>Vanilla</span> A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor. </li>
  <li> <span>Cooking Spray</span> You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles. </li>
  </ul>
